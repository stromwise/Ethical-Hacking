
# I must also emphasize that using RATs for unauthorized and unethical purposes is illegal and can have severe consequences. 

# If you are interested in learning more about RATs for educational purposes, I suggest exploring legitimate sources and tools, such as those provided by 
security training courses or certifications.

# These sources typically provide a controlled and safe environment for learning and experimentation.

# Remember, even if you have explicit consent and authorization from the owner, using RATs for malicious purposes is illegal and unethical. Always use RAT tools responsibly and for legitimate purposes only.


If you have proper authorization and explicit consent from the owner, and you are using a RAT tool for educational purposes only, you can consider using DarkComet RAT. Here are the steps to download and set up DarkComet RAT:


# Now that is a lot of power, so I have to throw out caution. 

# Please, please, please.Do not use this in any legal way. 

# I have to throw the disclaimer And you know, whatever you do with it, 

# I'm not going to be responsible because again, this is going to ,

# it just gives you a lot of control over, you know, 

# whoever's computer you try and attack, if that's what you're going to do. 

# So again, I'm not going to be responsible for this. 

# I'm just going to show you everything works in order to get it up and running, all right?
a lot of you guys have been asking me why I'm doing these with these type of content?
and the reason why I'm doing them is the special tools that I'm showcasing give you a good idea of how they work.
So essentially what I'm trying to show you here is I'm going to show you the tool and 
hopefully that will get your curiosity running and you'll be looking into making one of your own. So that's all I'm trying to do, right?
So and plus, this is a fantastic tool if you're using it the right way, right?
So again, it's really very simple.

# download Quasar rat from it official website realease file. 

- https://github.com/quasar/Quasar/releases


# now create a folder on desktop and extract the quasar files on that folder 


# now run the quasar.exe/application.


# it will open and build a certificate by just click on build/create and save.

# the tool will start.

now click BUILDER section.

# Now in here you can select your client tag and that's the name of the client that you want to specify.
this is just the name that you want to give to the computer you're going to be listening to,
example you can give any name it will show on the dashboard with this name.

# /selectTick/checkbox/mark on unattended mode.

# move to connections now if you are taking reverse shell on your network only then enter you ip here in IP/HOSTNAME.
leave the port as it is or if you want, you can specify the port as well.

# click on add host. 

# move to INSTALLATION SETTINGS

# click/tick/checkbox/mark  INSTALL CLIENT.

# select the Directory in which you want to install the file in the target device.

# better to select system.

# now type the INSTALL NAME: 
If you leave this like this right, 
and someone checks their task manager and goes to the startup option and they find something with a name like caser Client startup,
they're going to get a bit nervous. So you know, stay away from naming things that obvious. You know, you could name it something like Java Updater or something like that. So Java.

# choose a wise name so that no one will be able to detect it in the task manager.

# select/tick/checkbox/mark  SET FILE ATTRIBUTES TO HIDDEN AND SET SUB DIR ATTRIBUTES TO HIDDEN.

# select/tick/checkbox/mark RUN CLIENT ON STARTUP   

# and then give the start upname: you can choose the same as given above .

# now move to ASSEMBLY SETTINGS.
here you can give these options to make your app/trojan looks more legit/genuine.

# you can change ASSEMBLY ICON as well you can give the same icon as the name you kept.

# now click monitoring settings. 

# SELECT/tick/checkbox/mark  tick KEYBOARD/LOGGER AND ATTRIBUTES HIDDEN option.

# now you are all set CLICK BUILD CLIENT.
and then select the folder where you want to store the virus file that is build right now.
I would suggest to create a new folder and store it there.

# now click on the the SETTINGS and click start listning and specify the PORT which you defined in in the client virus file.

# now transfer the client.exe file file to the victim on the same network and disable firewall 

# run this file as an administrator. 

#BOOM YOU HAVE THE REVERSE SHELL YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
