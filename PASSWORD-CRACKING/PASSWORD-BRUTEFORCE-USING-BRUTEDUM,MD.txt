# IN THIS TOTURIAL YOU WILL LEARN HOW TO CRACK WEP WIFI SECURITY.

## YOU CAN USE KALI LINUX OS FOR BEST RESULTS.



### Download & Set Up BruteDum


STEP 1: git clone https://github.com/GitHackTools/BruteDum

STEP 2: cd BruteDum

STEP 3: wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/berzerk0/Probable-Wordlists/master/Real-Passwords/Top207-probable-v2.txt

### YOU CAN ADD PASSWORDS IN THIS FILE.

STEP 4: python3 brutedum.py



## Enter the Target Address


STEP 1: [?] Enter the victim address: 192.168.43.1

STEP 2: [?] Do you want to scan victim's ports with Nmap? [Y/n]: Y

After the loading screen finishes, we'll need to enter the IP address of the victim. Once you've done so, press Enter, and you'll be presented with the option to run an Nmap scan. It's a handy feature that can help you discover other services open on the same device. Type Y and hit Enter to run the Nmap scan.When the results return, you should be able to identify any ports that come back as "open." Next, you'll need to select a service to crack. The menu for doing so is quite easy to understand, and you can choose one that matches the service that our Nmap scan discovered.



## Select the Tool

We'll select Hydra, as it's the one recommended for cracking SSH. Type 2 to indicate Hydra (or the number of the tool you wish to use) and press Enter to begin configuring it.



## Set Username & Password Lists

To launch our attack, we'll need to make a time versus probability tradeoff. Our first option will be to select a username list. That means we'll be trying every password in our password list with every username in our username list. It can become a lot of attempts very quickly.

In our example, we can select N to decline using a username list. Instead, we'll use a common username, or one we might know exists by default on the type of device.

Because we declined to supply a username list, we'll have to enter one manually instead. Here, I'll enter toor, as I know that's the username for our test device.

Next, we'll need to set the password list. It won't work if we select a password list outside of the directory we're in, so we can now add the password list we downloaded earlier. If you followed along before, we should be able to just paste in the Top207-probable-v2.txt wordlist here.



## Launch the Attack

Finally, we can decide if we want to use the default port or not. Some devices may host services on a port other than the standard one, but this isn't very common. For SSH, the default port is 22, so we'll just enter Y and hit Enter.

If you're attacking a service on a non-standard port, you can specify it here and press Enter. Do not accidentally type in the number of the port you want to attack here, as the script will crash.

As soon as you supply the port, BruteDum will launch the tool you specified.
