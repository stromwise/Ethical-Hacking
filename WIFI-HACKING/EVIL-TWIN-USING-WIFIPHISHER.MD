## Plug in Your Wireless Network Adapter


## Run the Script

Step 1:  wifiphisher -i wlan1    ( -i flag to the command and add the name of my network adapter. )

Afterward, we should see a page showing every nearby network. We can select which network we want to attack here, and press Enter.

Step 2:  Next, the script will ask what attack you want to run. Select option 2 ( Firmware Upgrade Page ).

After selecting the attack, it will immediately launch. A page will open to monitor for targets joining the network. Wifiphisher will also listen for devices trying to connect to networks that aren't present, and it will create fake versions to lure those devices into connecting.After a target joins, a pop-up will demand they enter the password.When the target enters the password, we're notified in the Wifiphisher screen.

That's it! The script will exit and present you with the password you just captured.
