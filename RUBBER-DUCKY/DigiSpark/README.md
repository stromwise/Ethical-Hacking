# DigiSpark Attiny85 poor man's RubberDucky

For people who can't buy or are too cheap to buy RubberDucky, DigiSpark Attiny85 is the solution to their problems. Because it's possible to use it as HID thanks to "DigiKeyboard.h" it can be use as keyboard to send keystrokes to computer which can be use for pranking your people to creating a backdoor in target system.

# What's here?

I have created this repo for sharing my payloads for DigiSpark Attiny85. It's my first time programming any device and so far no fires. All the payloads are tested on Attiny85 and created on Arduino IDE.


# Getting Started

DigiSpark-Scripts
This is a set of hand-written DigiSpark sketches for the Arduino IDE that utilize the DigiKeyboard.h library making the DigiSpark to act as a keyboard and execute a variety of actions. If you have found a USB Rubber Ducky scipt that you want to convert to a DigiSpark sketch, you can always use digiQuack, a tool which can be found in my repositories.


# Instructions

Configure the Arduino IDE for the DigiSpark using: https://digistump.com/wiki/digispark/tutorials/connecting or Seytonic's tutorial: https://youtu.be/fGmGBa-4cYQ. Then download one of scripts (sketches), open them with Arduino IDE, modify them if needed and upload them to the DigiSpark.
