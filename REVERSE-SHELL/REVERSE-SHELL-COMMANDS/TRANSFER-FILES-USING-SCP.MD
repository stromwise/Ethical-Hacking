# To use scp to securely copy files between the Windows and Kali Linux machines, you need to have SSH (Secure Shell) access to both machines. Here are the basic steps:

- Open a terminal window on your Kali Linux machine.

- Use the scp command in the following format to copy a file from the Windows machine to the Kali Linux machine:


# scp user@windows-machine:/path/to/file /path/to/destination

Replace user with the username you use to log in to the Windows machine and windows-machine with the IP address or hostname of the Windows machine. Replace /path/to/file with the path to the file you want to copy from the Windows machine, and replace /path/to/destination with the path on your Kali Linux machine where you want to save the file.


For example, if you want to copy a file called document.docx from the C:\Users\John\Documents folder on the Windows machine to the /home/kali/Documents folder on your Kali Linux machine, you would use the following command:

# scp john@192.168.1.100:/c/Users/John/Documents/document.docx /home/kali/Documents

Note that you may need to enter the password for the Windows machine user account when prompted.

Use the scp command in the following format to copy a file from the Kali Linux machine to the Windows machine:


# scp /path/to/file user@windows-machine:/path/to/destination

Replace /path/to/file with the path to the file you want to copy from your Kali Linux machine, and replace /path/to/destination with the path on the Windows machine where you want to save the file. Replace user with the username you use to log in to the Windows machine, and replace windows-machine with the IP address or hostname of the Windows machine.


For example, if you want to copy a file called report.pdf from the /home/kali/Documents folder on your Kali Linux machine to the C:\Users\John\Documents folder on the Windows machine, you would use the following command:

# scp /home/kali/Documents/report.pdf john@192.168.1.100:/c/Users/John/Documents

Note that you may need to enter the password for the Windows machine user account when prompted.

Please note that scp transfers files in clear text, and is not as secure as other file transfer methods such as SFTP or FTPS. If security is a concern, consider using SFTP or FTPS instead.
