STEP 1:-  open THID GITHUB REPO ( https://github.com/dbisu/pico-ducky )
STEP 2:-  CircuitPython for the Raspberry Pi Pico ( https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/ )
STEP 3:-  connect the raspberry pi pico to the computer while pressing the buttion on the rasberry pi pico.
STEP 4:-  Now move the circuit python file in the raspberry pi pico  
STEP 5:-  now disconnect the raspberry pi pico and reconnect it 
STEP 6:-  now get back to github and downloawd ( adafruit-circuitpython-bundle-8.x-mpy-YYYYMMDD.zip )( https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/tag/20230526 )
STEP 7:-  extract the file adafruit**********.zip 
STEP 8:-  open it and open LIB FOLDER copy/paste the ( adafruit_hid )FOLDER to the raspberry pi pico LIB FOLDER.
STEP 9:-  Copy adafruit_debouncer.mpy and adafruit_ticks.mpy to the lib folder on your Raspberry Pi Pico.
STEP 10:-  Copy asyncio to the lib folder on your Pico.
STEP 11:-  Copy adafruit_wsgi to the lib folder on your Pico.
STEP 12:-  Copy boot.py from your clone to the root of your Pico.
STEP 13:-  Copy duckyinpython.py, webapp.py, wsgiserver.py to the root folder of the Pico.
STEP 14:-  delete the code.py from raspberry pi pico 
STEP 15:-  rename the duckyinpython.py to code.py
STEP 16:-  Find a script here(  ) or create your own one using Ducky Script( https://docs.hak5.org/hak5-usb-rubber-ducky/ducky-script-basics/hello-world ) and save it as payload.dd in the Pico. Currently, pico-ducky only supports DuckyScript 1.0, not 3.0.
STEP 17:-  after modifieing the script for the ducky just save it as ( PAYLOAD.DD ) 
STEP 18:-  now just copy paste the payload.dd in the raspberry pi pico but wait***********
STEP 19:-  as soon as you paste it it will start the code in 5 seconds so for that as soon as you paste it just remove the usb.

STEP #:-########### How to reset the raspberry pi pico to add a new code in it.  #####################
STEP 1:-  justconnect it while pressing the (BOOTSEL)/BUTTON on the raspberry pi pico and then connect it to the computer it will reset the module.
STEP 2:-  then copy/paste FLASH.NUKE ( https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/soft/flash_nuke.uf2 ) in the raspberry pi pico to flash it 
STEP 3:-  now you can again do the procedure to run a new script on the module.

STEP #:-  Setup mode
To edit the payload, enter setup mode by connecting the pin 1 (GP0) to pin 3 (GND), this will stop the pico-ducky from injecting the payload in your own machine. The easiest way to do so is by using a jumper wire between those pins as seen bellow.

STEP #:-  Setup mode with a jumper

please check the images provided

If you need the pico-ducky to not show up as a USB mass storage device for stealth, follow these instructions.

* Enter setup mode.
* Copy your payload script to the pico-ducky.
* Disconnect the pico from your host PC.
* Connect a jumper wire between pin 18 (GND) and pin 20 (GPIO15).
  This will prevent the pico-ducky from showing up as a USB drive when plugged into the target computer.
* Remove the jumper and reconnect to your PC to reprogram.

Pico: The default mode is USB mass storage enabled.

STEP #:-  Pico W: The default mode is USB mass storage disabled
PLease check the images provided.

STEP #:-  Multiple payloads
Multiple payloads can be stored on the Pico and Pico W.
To select a payload, ground one of these pins:

* GP4 - payload.dd
* GP5 - payload2.dd
* GP10 - payload3.dd
* GP11 - payload4.dd
